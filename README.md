# C&C Remastered Collection

This code is the game logic for Command and Conquer: Tiberian Dawn, and Command and Conquer: Red Alert. 
EA did not open source any assets beyond this source and only this source is under GPLv3. In order to obtain the rest of the game 
you must purchase from Steam or Origin. Once you have purchased the game you can play it and mod it to your heart's content.

## All Inclusive Mod Goal

This mod's goal is to provide an all-inclusive experience via most popular existing mods and commonly requested features. The changes proposed
are ones that arguably could have been included in the base game. Note: Since the base game is a remaster, not a remake, more modern features (see CFE Patch
notes below) will not be implemented.

### Included Mods
-Balanced resource growth (TD & RA)  [ADDED via rules.ini (RA) and Type.h change (TD)]  
-Additional Zoom Levels (TD & RA) by CCHyper [ADDED via XML files]  
-Rename Attack Helicopter to Longbow by CCHyper [ADDED via csv files, optimally want to enable in DLL somehow]  
-Rename Light Scout to Hum-vee by CCHyper [ADDED via csv files, optimally want to enable in DLL somehow]  
-Unlock Helicarrier & Phase Tank by CCHyper [ADDED via ini files, optimally want to enable in DLL somehow]  
-One-cell gap for base construction (TD) by FluffyQuack [ADDED to DLL]  
-Modern Wall Building (TD & RA) by Sleipnir/pchote [ADDED to DLL]  

### To-Be-Added
-Smarter harvesting (TD & RA)  
-Balanced difficulties (TD & RA)  
-More hotkeys (specifically 'D' to deploy) (TD & RA)  

## Differences from CFE Patch
CFE Patch (by cfehunter) features some extra modernizations that, in my opinion, sort of break the "feel" of the remaster (making it more of a remake).
Features such as Rally Points, Repair With No Cash, and A-Star Pathfinding will not be merged into this mod.

CFE Patch is welcome to use any features existing in this mod (either because I didn't design them myself or because permission is granted).
