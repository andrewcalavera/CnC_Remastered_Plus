# C&C Remastered Collection

This code is the game logic for Command and Conquer: Tiberian Dawn, and Command and Conquer: Red Alert. 
EA did not open source any assets beyond this source and only this source is under GPLv3. In order to obtain the rest of the game 
you must purchase from Steam or Origin. Once you have purchased the game you can play it and mod it to your heart's content.

## All Inclusive Mod Goal

This mod's goal is to provide an all-inclusive experience via most popular existing mods and commonly requested features. The changes proposed
are ones that arguably could have been included in the base game. The following is a "wishlist" of features to be added to this All-Inclusive Mod:

-Modern Wall Building (TD & RA) by Sleipnir  
-Additional Zoom Levels (TD & RA) by CCHyper [ADDED via XML files]  
-Rename Attack Helicopter to Longbow by CCHyper [ADDED via csv files, optimally want to enable in DLL somehow]  
-Rename Light Scout to Hum-vee by CCHyper [ADDED via csv files, optimally want to enable in DLL somehow]  
-Unlock Helicarrier & Phase Tank by CCHyper [ADDED via ini files, optimally want to enable in DLL somehow]  
-One-cell gap for base construction (TD) by FluffyQuack [ADDED to DLL]
